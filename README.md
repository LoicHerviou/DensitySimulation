# DensitySimulation

You can find in the repo the two versions (Suzuki-Trotter/Runge-Kotta) of the algorithm discuss.

ToDo:
- Improve the Suzuki-Trotter algorithm to higher order and to more efficient evolve matrix
- Stabilize a bit its conde (remove const)
- For both algorithms: better marginal evaluation
- implement nicer API
