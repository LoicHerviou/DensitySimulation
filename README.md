# DensitySimulation


You can find in the repo the two versions (Suzuki-Trotter/Runge-Kotta) of the algorithm discuss.

I will most likely do a massive refactoring if we want to work in parallel.

ToDo: 
Separate the different subparts of the algorithm to make it more modular:
- Hamiltonian generation
- Traces operators and generation of other operators
- Core of the time evolution
